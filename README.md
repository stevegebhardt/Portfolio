GA Portfolio

I, for all intents and purposes, created a MySpace page.  Gave it background photo, a header with tabs, a footer that has a "Night Mode/Blue Light Filter", and a drop down menu with links to Social Media Sites, Git Hub and a modal with a carousel.
I knew the approximate layout that I wanted so I started by building up the html first.  Then I started adjusting the styles in CSS and a few JQuery commands.  Lastly I finished the JQuery commands and made any further adjustments I felt like.
