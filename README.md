GA Portfolio

I, for all intents and purposes, created a MySpace page. Gave it background photo, a header with tabs, a footer that has a "Night Mode/Blue Light Filter", and a drop down menu with links to Social Media Sites, Git Hub and a modal with a carousel.
I knew the approximate layout that I wanted so I started by building up the html first. Then I started adjusting the styles in CSS and a few JQuery commands. Lastly I finished the JQuery commands and made any further adjustments I felt like.

I have a few event listeners in Jquery along with some hover effects in CSS.

In a nod to the video games of my youth, I hid an egg on the page. It's not something you can see, but rather something you need to explore and experiment to find. If you do find it you are rewarded with a modest prize.
