          These are one-on-one games with 60 card minimums for the main deck
          plus a sideboard of up to 15 cards. A deck may not contain more than 4
          of any individual card, excluding basic lands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Build decks using cards that are readily available! In this Magic
          format, all cards must have been released at common rarity in a
          Magicâ€¯set or product. Common promo cards are only legal if the card
          meets that qualification.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a common version of a particular card was ever released in a Magic:
          The Gathering paper product or Magic: The Gathering Online, any
          version of that card is legal in this format. This includes land cards
          that were printed with both a common set symbol and the L rarity code.
        </p>
        <p class="tenpx-spacing">
          Cards from all regular core sets and expansions since Eight Edition
          are legal.
