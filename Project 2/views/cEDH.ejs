        <p>
          CEDH is the official abbreviation for the Competitive Elder Dragon
          Highlander MTG format. The CEDH game mode is a fan favorite, to say
          the least. The format isn't much different than other modes, just with
          a focus on the Elder Dragon Highlander cards and playing very
          competitively in person and online.

        <h4>What's the Diference between cEDH and Commander?</h4>
        <p>
          cEDH and Commander (a.k.a. EDH (Elder Dragon Highlander)) are two peas
          in a pod. One did exist before the other, sure, but they are both in
          essence the same exact game, mode, and format. They are both best
          played with 2-3 players (or more) and share the same turn order (as
          well as using the same theme decks and Commander cards).
